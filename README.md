# pyifcb - Imaging FlowCytobot Python API, generation 2

## Overview

This module provides facilities for accessing and managing data generated by the Imaging FlowCytobot. It can read and write IFCB data in various formats, including the instrument's native format, and can serve as the basis of any application that uses IFCB data.

Generation 1 of this data system was called the IFCB Data Dashboard. In this, generation 2, features of the dashboard are being broken out into smaller, independent modules that can be used together.

## Status

As of 2016-09-05 this is an incomplete and experimental module and should not be considered ready to be used in production applications. The APIs are subject to change at any time and so are undocumented. There is currently no planned release date.
